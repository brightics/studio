.SH "NAME"
graphviz \- rich set of graph drawing tools

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
This manpage has been written to fulfil the need of a centralized documentation
presenting all available tools in the graphviz package.

.SH "AVAILABLE TOOLS"

.SS "Graph layout programs"
.TP
.B dot
filter for hierarchical layouts of graphs
.TP
.B neato
filter for symmetric layouts of graphs
.TP
.B twopi
filter for radial layouts of graphs
.TP
.B circo
filter for circular layout of graphs
.TP
.B fdp
filter for symmetric layouts of graphs
.PP
All of the filters work with either directed or undirected graphs, though
.B dot
is typically used for directed graphs and
.B neato
for undirected graphs.
Note also that \fBneato \-n[2]\fP can be used to render layouts produced
by the other filters.

.SH "AUTHOR"
This manual page was written by Cyril Brulebois
<cyril.brulebois@enst\-bretagne.fr> in november 2006, based on an initial
documentation effort by Joachim Berdal Haga <jbh@lupus.ig3.net>. It can be
distributed under the same terms as the graphviz package.
