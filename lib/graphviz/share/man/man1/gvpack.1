.SH NAME
gvpack \- merge and pack disjoint graphs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gvpack

.B \-nguv?
]

.BI \-m margin
]
[
.BI \-o outfile
]
[
.BI \-G name\fB=\fPvalue

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gvpack
reads in a stream of graphs, combines the graphs into a single
layout, and produces a single graph serving as the union of the
input graphs. The input graphs must be in dot format, and must have
all necessary layout information. Acceptable input is produced
by applying a Graphviz layout program, such as \fBdot\fP or \fBneato\fP, 
with no \fB\-T\fP flag.
.P
By default, the packing is done at the cluster level. Thus, parts of
one graph will not intrude into any top\(hylevel clusters or overlap
any nodes or edges of another.
.P
The output of \fBgvpack\fP can be used to produce concrete output
by applying \fBneato \-s \-n2\fP with the desired \fB\-T\fP flag.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.B \-g
Combines the graphs at the graph level. This uses more space, but prevents
parts of one graph from occurring between parts of another. 
.TP
.BI \-G "name\fB=\fPvalue"
Specifies attributes to be added to the resulting union graph. For
example, this can be used to specify a graph label.
.TP
.BI \-m "margin"
Packs the graphs allowing a margin of \fIoutput\fP points around
the parts.
.TP
.B \-n
Combines the graphs at the node level. Clusters are ignored in the packing.
.TP
.BI \-o "output"
Prints output to the file \fIoutput\fP. If not given, \fBgvpack\fP
uses stdout.
.TP
.B \-u
Don't pack the graphs. Just combine them into a single graph.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode.
.TP
.B \-?
Prints usage information and exit.
.SH OPERANDS
The following operand is supported:
.TP 8
.I files
Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in dot format.
If no
.I files
operand is specified,
the standard input will be used.
.SH RETURN CODES
.B gvpack
returns
.B 0
if there were no problems, and non\(hyzero otherwise.
.SH EXAMPLES
.EX
ccomps \-x abc.dot | dot | gvpack | neato \-s \-n2 \-Tps
.EE
This pipeline decomposes the graph in \fIabc.dot\fP into its
connected components, lays out each using \fBdot\fP, packs them all together
again, and produces the final drawing in PostScript. Of course, 
there is nothing to prevent one from using different layouts for
each component.
.SH "BUGS"
All the input graphs must be directed or undirected.
.P
An input graph should not have a label, since this will be used in its
layout. Since \fBgvpack\fP ignores root graph labels, resulting layout
may contain some extra space.
.P
\fBgvpack\fP unsets the bounding box attribute of all non\(hycluster
subgraphs.
