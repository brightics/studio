.SH NAME
gvpr \- graph pattern scanning and processing language
.br
( previously known as
.B gpr
)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gvpr
[\fB\-icqV?\fP]
[
.BI \-o
.I outfile
]
[
.BI \-a
.I args
]
[
.I 'prog'
|
.BI \-f
.I progfile
]
[ 
.I files 
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gvpr
is a graph stream editor inspired by \fBawk\fP.
It copies input graphs to its
output, possibly transforming their structure and attributes,
creating new graphs, or printing arbitrary information.
The graph model is that provided by
.IR libcgraph (3).
In particular, \fBgvpr\fP reads and writes graphs using the
dot language.
.PP
Basically,
.B gvpr
traverses each input graph, denoted by \fB$G\fP, visiting each node and edge,
matching it with the predicate\(hyaction rules supplied in the input program.
The rules are evaluated in order.
For each predicate evaluating to true, the corresponding 
action is performed. 
During the traversal, the current node or edge being visited
is denoted by \fB$\fP.
.PP
For each input graph, there is a target subgraph, denoted by
\fB$T\fP, initially empty and used to accumulate
chosen entities, and an output graph, \fB$O\fP, used for final processing
and then written to output. 
By default, the output graph is the target graph.
The output graph can be set in the program or, in a limited sense,
on the command line.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-a " args"
The string \fIargs\fP is split into whitespace\(hyseparated tokens, 
with the individual tokens
available as strings in the \fBgvpr\fP program 
as \fBARGV[\fI0\fP],...,ARGV[ARGC\-1]\fR.
Whitespace characters within single or double quoted substrings, or
preceded by a backslash, are ignored as separators. 
In general, a backslash character turns off any special meaning of the
following character.
Note that the tokens derived from multiple \fB\-a\fP flags are concatenated.
.TP
.B \-c
Use the source graph as the output graph.
.TP
.B \-i
Derive the node\(hyinduced subgraph extension of the output graph in the context 
of its root graph.
.TP
.BI \-o " outfile"
Causes the output stream to be written to the specified file; by default,
output is written to \fBstdout\fP.
.TP
.BI \-f " progfile"
Use the contents of the specified file as the program to execute
on the input. If \fIprogfile\fP contains a slash character, the name is taken
as the pathname of the file. Otherwise, \fBgvpr\fP will use the
directories specified in the environment variable \fBGPRPATH\fP to look
for the file. If 
.B \-f
is not given,
.B gvpr
will use the first non\(hyoption argument as the program.
.TP
.B \-q
Turns off warning messages.
.TP
.B \-V
Causes the program to print version information and exit.
.TP
.B \-?
Causes the program to print usage information and exit.
.SH OPERANDS
The following operand is supported:
.TP 8
.I files
Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in the dot language.
If no
.B \-f
option is given, the first name is removed from the list and used 
as the input program. If the list of files is empty, \fBstdin\fP will be used.
.SH PROGRAMS
A
.B gvpr
program consists of a list of predicate\(hyaction clauses, having one
of the forms:
.IP
.BI "BEGIN { "  action " }"
.IP
.BI "BEG_G { "  action " }"
.IP
.BI "N [ " predicate " ] { " action " }
.IP
.BI "E [ " predicate " ] { " action " }
.IP
.BI "END_G { "  action " }"
.IP
.BI "END { "  action " }"
.PP
A program can contain at most one of each of the \fBBEGIN\fP, \fBBEG_G\fP,
\fBEND_G\fP and \fBEND\fP clauses. 
There can be any number of \fBN\fP and \fBE\fP statements,
the first applied to nodes, the second to edges.
The top\(hylevel semantics of a \fBgvpr\fP program are:
.PP
.ta \w'\f(CWdelete array[expression]'u
.RS
.nf
Evaluate the \fBBEGIN\fP clause, if any.
For each input graph \fIG\fP {
    Set \fIG\fP as the current graph and current object.
    Evaluate the \fBBEG_G\fP clause, if any.
    For each node and edge in \fIG\fP {
      Set the node or edge as the current object.
      Evaluate the \fBN\fP or \fBE\fP clauses, as appropriate.
    } 
    Set \fIG\fP as the current object.
    Evaluate the \fBEND_G\fP clause, if any.
} 
Evaluate the \fBEND\fP clause, if any.
.fi
.RE
.DT
.PP
The actions of the \fBBEGIN\fP, \fBBEG_G\fP, \fBEND_G\fP and \fBEND\fP clauses
are performed when the clauses are evaluated.
For \fBN\fP or \fBE\fP clauses,
either the predicate or action may be omitted. 
If there is no predicate with an action, the action is 
performed on every node or edge, as appropriate.
If there is no action and the predicate evaluates to true,
the associated node or edge is added to the target graph. 
.PP
Predicates and actions are sequences of statements in the C dialect 
supported by the
.IR libexpr (3)
library.
The only difference between predicates and actions is that the former
must have a type that may interpreted as either true or false.
Here the usual C convention is followed, in which a non\(hyzero value is
considered true. This would include non\(hyempty strings and non\(hyempty
references to nodes, edges, etc. However, if a string can be 
converted to an integer, this value is used.
.PP
In addition to the usual C base types
(\fBvoid\fP, \fBint\fP, \fBchar\fP, \fBfloat\fP, \fBlong\fP, 
\fBunsigned\fP and \fBdouble\fP), 
\fBgvpr\fP \fRprovides \fBstring\fP as a synonym for \fBchar*\fP, and 
the graph\(hybased types \fBnode_t\fP,
\fBedge_t\fP, \fBgraph_t\fP and \fBobj_t\fP.
The \fBobj_t\fP type can be viewed as a supertype of the other 3 concrete types;
the correct base type is maintained dynamically.
Besides these base types, the only other supported type expressions
are (associative) arrays. 
.PP
Constants follow C syntax, but strings may be quoted with either
\fB"..."\fP or \fB'...'\fP. In certain contexts, string values are
interpreted as patterns for the purpose of regular expression matching.
Patterns use
.IR ksh (1)
file match pattern syntax.
\fBgvpr\fP accepts C++ comments as well as cpp\(hytype comments.
For the latter, if a line begins with a '#' character, the rest of
the line is ignored.
.PP
A statement can be a declaration of a function, a variable
or an array, or an executable statement. For declarations, there
is a single scope. Array declarations have the form: 
.PP
.ta \w'\f(CWdelete array[expression]'u
.RS
.nf
\fI type array \fB[\fP type0 \fB]\fR
.fi
.RE
.DT
.PP
where \fI type0 \fP is optional. If it is supplied, the parser will 
enforce that all array subscripts have the specified type. If it is
not supplied, objects of all types can be used as subscripts.
As in C, variables and arrays must
be declared. In particular, an undeclared variable will be interpreted
as the name of an attribute of a node, edge or graph, depending on the
context.
.PP
Executable statements can be one of the following:
.ta \w'\f(CWdelete array[expression]'u
.RS
.nf
\fB{\fR [\fI statement ... \fR] \fB}\fR
\fIexpression\fP	\fR// commonly\fP\fI var \fB=\fP expression\fR
\fBif(\fI expression \fP)\fI statement \fR[ \fBelse\fI statement \fR]
\fBfor(\fI expression \fP;\fI expression \fP;\fI expression \fP)\fI statement\fP
\fBfor(\fI array \fP[\fI var \fP])\fI statement\fP
\fBwhile(\fI expression \fP)\fI statement\fP
\fBswitch(\fI expression \fP)\fI case statements\fP
\fBbreak [\fI expression \fP]
\fBcontinue [\fI expression \fP]
\fBreturn [\fI expression \fP]\fR
.fi
.RE
.ST
Items in brackets are optional.
.PP
In the second form of the \fBfor\fP statement, the variable \fIvar\fP
is set to each value used as an index in the specified array and then
the associated \fIstatement\fP is evaluated. Function definitions can
only appear in the \fBBEGIN\fP clause.
.PP
Expressions include the usual C expressions. 
String comparisons using \fB==\fP and \fB!=\fP
treat the right hand operand as a pattern.
\fBgvpr\fP will attempt to use an expression as a string or numeric value 
as appropriate.
.PP
Expressions of graphical type (i.e., \fBgraph_t, node_t,
edge_t, obj_t\fP) may be followed by a field reference in the
form of \fB.\fP\fIname\fP. The resulting value is the value
of the attribute named \fIname\fP of the given object.
In addition, in certain contexts an undeclared, unmodified
identifier is taken to be an
attribute name. Specifically, such identifiers denote attributes
of the current node or edge, respectively, in \fBN\fP
and \fBE\fP clauses, and the current graph in \fBBEG_G\fP and \fBEND_G\fP
clauses.
.PP
As usual in the 
.IR libcgraph (3)
model, attributes are string\(hyvalued.
In addition,
.B gvpr
supports certain pseudo\(hyattributes of graph objects, not necessarily
string\(hyvalued. These reflect intrinsic properties of the graph objects
and cannot be set by the user.
.TP
\fBhead\fR : \fBnode_t\fR
the head of an edge.
.TP
\fBtail\fR : \fBnode_t\fR
the tail of an edge.
.TP
\fBname\fR : \fBstring\fR
the name of an edge, node or graph. The name of an edge has the
form "\fI<tail\(hyname><edge\(hyop><head\(hyname>\fB[\fI<key>\fB]\fR",
where \fI<edge\(hyop>\fP is "\fB\->\fP" or "\fB\-\-\fP" depending on
whether the graph is directed or not. The bracket part \fB[\fI<key>\fB]\fR
only appears if the edge has a non\(hytrivial key.
.TP

the indegree of a node.
.TP
\fBoutdegree\fR : \fBint\fR
the outdegree of a node.
.TP
\fBdegree\fR : \fBint\fR

the root graph of an object. The root of a root graph
is itself.
.TP
\fBparent\fR : \fBgraph_t\fR
the parent graph of a subgraph. The parent of a root graph
is \fBNULL\fP
.TP
\fBn_edges\fR : \fBint\fR
the number of edges in the graph
.TP

.SH "BUILT\(hyIN FUNCTIONS"
.PP

specified by the string \fIt\fP. Ignoring case, the characters
\fBU, D, S, N\fR have the interpretation undirected, directed,
strict, and non\(hystrict, respectively. If \fIt\fP is empty,
a directed, non\(hystrict graph is generated.

creates an edge with tail node \fIt\fP, head node \fIh\fP and
name \fIs\fP in the root graph. If the graph is undirected, the

.TP
\fBedge_sg\fP(\fIsg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP, \fIt\fP : \fBnode_t\fP, \fIh\fP : \fBnode_t\fP, \fIs\fP : \fBstring\fP) : \fBedge_t\fP
creates an edge with tail node \fIt\fP, head node \fIh\fP and name \fIs\fP

looks for an edge with tail node \fIt\fP, head node \fIh\fP and
name \fIs\fP in (sub)graph \fIsg\fP. If the graph is undirected, the distinction between

.SS "Graph I/O"
.TP
\fBwrite\fP(\fIg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP) : \fBvoid\fP
prints \fIg\fP in dot format onto the output stream.
.TP
\fBwriteG\fP(\fIg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP, \fIfname\fP : \fBstring\fP) : \fBvoid\fP

.TP
\fBreadG\fP(\fIfname\fP : \fBstring\fP) : \fBgraph_t\fP

returns the next graph read from the open stream \fIfd\fP.
Returns \fBNULL\fP at end of file.
.SS "Graph miscellany"
.TP
\fBdelete\fP(\fIg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP, \fIx\fP : \fBobj_t\fP) : \fBvoid\fP
deletes object \fIx\fP from graph \fIg\fP.
If \fIg\fP is \fBNULL\fP, the function uses the root graph of \fIx\fP.
If \fIx\fP is a graph or subgraph, it is closed unless \fIx\fP is locked.
.TP
\fBisIn\fP(\fIg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP, \fIx\fP : \fBobj_t\fP) : \fBint\fP
returns true if \fIx\fP is in subgraph \fIg\fP.
.TP
\fBclone\fP(\fIg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP, \fIx\fP : \fBobj_t\fP) : \fBobj_t\fP
creates a clone of object \fIx\fP in graph \fIg\fP.
In particular, the new object has the same name/value attributes
and structure as the original object.
If an object with the same key as \fIx\fP already exists, its attributes
are overlaid by those of \fIx\fP and the object is returned.
If an edge is cloned, both endpoints are implicitly cloned.
If a graph is cloned, all nodes, edges and subgraphs are implicitly
cloned.
If \fIx\fP is a graph, \fIg\fP may be \fBNULL\fP, in which case the cloned
object will be a new root graph.
.TP
\fBcopy\fP(\fIg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP, \fIx\fP : \fBobj_t\fP) : \fBobj_t\fP
creates a copy of object \fIx\fP in graph \fIg\fP,
where the new object has the same name/value attributes
as the original object.
If an object with the same key as \fIx\fP already exists, its attributes
are overlaid by those of \fIx\fP and the object is returned.
Note that this is a shallow copy. If \fIx\fP is a graph, none of its nodes, 
edges or subgraphs are copied into the new graph. If \fIx\fP is an edge,
the endpoints are created if necessary, but they are not cloned.
If \fIx\fP is a graph, \fIg\fP may be \fBNULL\fP, in which case the cloned
object will be a new root graph.
.TP
\fBcopyA\fP(\fIsrc\fP : \fBobj_t\fP, \fItgt\fP : \fBobj_t\fP) : \fBint\fP
copies the attributes of object \fIsrc\fP to object \fItgt\fP, overwriting
any attribute values \fItgt\fP may initially have.
.TP
\fBinduce\fP(\fIg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP) : \fBvoid\fP
extends \fIg\fP to its node\(hyinduced subgraph extension in its root graph.
.TP
\fBhasAttr\fP(\fIsrc\fP : \fBobj_t\fP, \fIname\fP : \fBstring\fP) : \fBint\fP
returns non-zero if object \fIsrc\fP has an attribute whose name is
\fIname\fP. It returns 0 otherwise.
.TP
\fBisAttr\fP(\fIg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP, \fIkind\fP : \fBstring\fP, \fIname\fP : \fBstring\fP) : \fBint\fP
returns non-zero if an attribute \fIname\fP has been defined in \fIg\fP
for objects of the given \fIkind\fP. For nodes, edges, and graphs, \fIkind\fP
should be "N", "E", and "G", respectively.
It returns 0 otherwise.
.TP
\fBaget\fP(\fIsrc\fP : \fBobj_t\fP, \fIname\fP : \fBstring\fP) : \fBstring\fP
returns the value of attribute \fIname\fP in object \fIsrc\fP. This is
useful for those cases when \fIname\fP conflicts with one of the keywords
such as "head" or "root".
If the attribute has not been declared in the graph, the function will
initialize it with a default value of "". To avoid this, one should use

.TP

sets the value of attribute \fIname\fP in object \fIsrc\fP to \fIvalue\fP.
Returns 0 on success, non\(hyzero on failure. See \fBaget\fP above.
.TP
\fBgetDflt\fP(\fIg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP, \fIkind\fP : \fBstring\fP, \fIname\fP : \fBstring\fP) : \fBstring\fP
returns the default value of attribute \fIname\fP in objects in \fIg\fP of
the given \fIkind\fP. For nodes, edges, and graphs, \fIkind\fP
should be "N", "E", and "G", respectively.
If the attribute has not been declared in the graph, the function will
initialize it with a default value of "". To avoid this, one should use
the \fBisAttr\fP function to check that the attribute exists.
.TP
\fBsetDflt\fP(\fIg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP, \fIkind\fP : \fBstring\fP, \fIname\fP : \fBstring\fP, \fIvalue\fP : \fBstring\fP) : \fBint\fP
sets the default value of attribute \fIname\fP to \fIvalue\fP in 
objects in \fIg\fP of
the given \fIkind\fP. For nodes, edges, and graphs, \fIkind\fP
should be "N", "E", and "G", respectively.

.TP
\fBnxtAttr\fP(\fIg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP, \fIkind\fP : \fBstring\fP, \fIname\fP : \fBstring\fP) : \fBstring\fP
returns the name of the next attribute of objects in \fIg\fP of
the given \fIkind\fP after the attribute \fIname\fP. 
The argument \fIname\fP must be the name of an existing attribute; it will
typically be the return value of an previous call to \fBfstAttr\fP or
\fBnxtAttr\fP.
For nodes, edges, and graphs, \fIkind\fP
should be "N", "E", and "G", respectively.
If there are no attributes left, the string "" is returned.

returns the connected component of the graph \fIg\fP containing node \fIn\fP,
as a subgraph of \fIg\fP. The subgraph only contains the nodes. One can
use \fIinduce\fP to add the edges. The function fails and returns \fBNULL\fP
if \fIn\fP is not in \fIg\fP. Connectivity is based on the underlying
undirected graph of \fIg\fP.
.TP
\fBkindOf\fP(\fIobj\fP : \fBobj_t\fP) : \fBstring\fP
returns an indication of what kind of graph object is the argument.

should be "N", "E", and "G", respectively.
.TP
\fBlock\fP(\fIg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP, \fIv\fP : \fBint\fP) : \fBint\fP
implements graph locking on root graphs. If the integer \fIv\fP is positive, the
graph is set so that future calls to \fBdelete\fP have no immediate effect.
If \fIv\fP is zero, the graph is unlocked. If there has been a call
to delete the graph while it was locked, the graph is closed.
If \fIv\fP is negative, nothing is done.
In all cases, the previous lock value is returned.

To do the traversal, \fBgvpr\fP will check the value of
\fB$tvroot\fP. If this has the same value that it had previously

component. On the other hand, if \fB$tvroot\fP has changed, its connected
component will be toured, assuming it has not been previously visited or,
if \fB$tvroot\fP is \fBNULL\fP, the traversal will stop. Note that using
\fBTV_dfs\fP and \fB$tvroot\fP, it is possible to create an infinite loop.

By default, the traversal is done in pre-order. That is, a node is
visited before all of its unvisited edges. For \fBTV_postdfs\fR,

.SH BUGS AND WARNINGS
When the program is given as a command line argument, the usual
shell interpretation takes place, which may affect some of the
special names in \fBgvpr\fP. To avoid this, it is best to wrap the
program in single quotes.
.PP
As of 24 April 2008, \fBgvpr\fP switched to using a new, underlying
graph library, which uses the simpler model that there is only one
copy of a node, not one copy for each subgraph logically containing
it. This means that iterators such as \Inxtnode\P cannot traverse
a subgraph using just a node argument. For this reason, subgraph
traversal requires new functions ending in "_sg", which also take
a subgraph argument. The versions without that suffix will always
traverse the root graph.
.PP
There is a single global scope, except for formal function parameters,
and even these can interfere with the type system. Also, the 
extent of all variables is the entire life of the program. 
It might be preferable for scope
to reflect the natural nesting of the clauses, or for the program
to at least reset locally declared variables.
For now, it is advisable to use distinct names for all variables.
.PP
If a function ends with a complex statement, such as an
IF statement, with each branch doing a return, type checking may fail. 
Functions should use a return at the end.
.PP
The expr library does not support string values of (char*)0.
This means we can't distinguish between "" and (char*)0 edge keys.
For the purposes of looking up and creating edges, we translate "" 
to be (char*)0, since this latter value is
necessary in order to look up any edge with a matching head and tail.
.PP
Related to this, strings converted to integers act like char pointers,
getting the value 0 or 1 depending on whether the string consists
solely of zeroes or not. Thus, the ((int)"2") evaluates to 1.
.PP
The language inherits the usual C problems such as dangling references
and the confusion between '=' and '=='.
