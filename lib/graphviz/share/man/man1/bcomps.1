.SH NAME
bcomps \- biconnected components filter for graphs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bcomps
[
.B \-stvx?
]
[
.BI -o outfile
]
[ 
.I files
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bcomps
decomposes graphs into their biconnected components,
printing the components to standard output.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.B \-s
No output graph is printed. Implies the
.B \-v 
flag.
.TP
.B \-t
Print the underlying block-cutvertex tree.
.TP
.B \-x
Each biconnected component is printed as a separate root graph.
.TP
.B \-v
Prints number of blocks and cutvertices.
.TP
.BI \-o " outfile"
If specified, each root graph will be written to a different file
with the names derived from \fIoutfile\fP. In particular, 
if both \fB-o\fP and \fB-x\fP flags are used, then each
block is written to a different file. If \fIoutfile\fP does
not have a suffix, the nth block of the ith graph is written 
to \fIoutfile_n_i\fP. However, the 0th block of the 0th graph is written to
\fIoutfile\fP.
.sp
If \fIoutfile\fP has a suffix, i.e., has the form \fIbase.sfx\fP,
then the files will have the same name as above, except appended with \fI.sfx\fP.
.sp
The block-cutvertex tree of ith graph is written to \fIoutfile_n_T\fP,
with an appended suffix if specified.
.LP
By default, each input graph is printed, with each
block given as a subgraph whose name is a concatenation of
the name of the input graph, the string "_bcc_" and the
number of the block.
.SH OPERANDS
The following operand is supported:
.TP 8
.I files
Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in dot format.
If no
.I files
operand is specified,
the standard input will be used.
.SH RETURN CODES
.B bcomps
returns
.B 0
if all the input graphs are biconnected; and
non-zero if any graph has multiple blocks, or any error occurred.
.SH "BUGS"
It is possible, though unlikely, that the names used for connected
components and their subgraphs may conflict with existing subgraph names.
