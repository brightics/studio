.SH NAME
sccmap \- extract strongly connected components of directed graphs
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsccmap\fR
[\fB\-dsv\fR]
[
.I files
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I sccmap
decomposes digraphs into strongly connected components
and an auxiliary map of the relationship between components.
In this map, each component is collapsed into a node.
The resulting graphs are printed to standard out.
The number of nodes, edges and strongly connected components
are printed to standard error.
.B sccmap
is a way of partitioning large graphs into more manageable pieces.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.B \-d
Preserve degenerate components of only one node.
.TP
.B \-s
Do not print the resulting graphs. Only the statistics are
important.
.TP
.B \-S
Just print the resulting graphs. No statistics are printed.
.TP
.B \-v
Generate additional statistics. In particular,
.B sccmap
prints the number of nodes, edges, connected components,
and strongly connected components, followed by the fraction of
nodes in a non-trivial strongly connected components,
the maximum degree of the graph, and fraction of non-tree edges
in the graph.
.SH OPERANDS
The following operand is supported:
.TP 8
.I files
Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in dot format.
If no
.I files
operand is specified,
the standard input will be used.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
\fBsccmap\fP emits a warning if it encounters an undirected graph,
and ignores it.
