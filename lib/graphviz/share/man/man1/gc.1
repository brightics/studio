.SH NAME
gc \- count graph components
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gc
[
.B \-necCaDUrs?
]
[ 
.I files
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gc
is a graph analogue to 
.B wc 
in that it prints to standard output 
the number of nodes, edges, connected components or clusters contained
in the input files.
It also prints a total count for
all graphs if more than one graph is given.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.B \-n
Count nodes.
.TP
.B \-e
Count edges.
.TP
.B \-c
Count connected components.
.TP
.B \-C
Count clusters. By definition, a cluster is a graph or
subgraph whose name begins with "cluster".
.TP
.B \-a
Count all. Equivalent to
.B \-encC
.TP
.B \-r
Recursively analyze subgraphs.
.TP
.B \-s
Print no output. Only exit value is important.
.TP
.B \-D
Only analyze directed graphs.
.TP
.B \-U
Only analyze undirected graphs.
.TP
.B \-?
Print usage information.
.LP
By default, 
.I gc
returns the number of nodes and edges.
.SH OPERANDS
The following operand is supported:
.TP 8
.I files
Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in dot format.
If no
.I files
operand is specified,
the standard input will be used.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The following exit values are returned:
.TP 4
.B 0
Successful completion.
.TP
.B 1
The
.B \-U
or
.B \-E
option was used, and a graph of the wrong type was encountered.
