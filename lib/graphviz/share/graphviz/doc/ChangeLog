	- The gd plugin for font handlers was not being used at all if the build
	did not use fontconfig, e.g., on Windows. In addition, the code had
	dropped the name mapping to Windows font names.
	- PostScript output had an extraneous '%' character on the first line,
	which would cause printing to fail.
	- Text handling, during both sizing and layout, incorrectly handled
	empty lines such as label="\nabc".
	- HTML-like tables had been changed to use too much vertical space,
	to possibly use the wrong font in calculating the height of a line,
	and to use the wrong offset when moving the baseline from one line to
	the next.
November 27, 2006
	- release 2.10
	- dot - New pango+cairo renderer plugin (was in separate graphviz-cairo tree).
	  -- -Tpng now uses cairo   (-Tpng:gd for old gd based renderer)
	  -- -Tpdf now available
	  -- -Tps:cairo now available (-Tps is a direct ps renderer not based on cairo)
	  -- -Tsvg:cairo now available (-Tsvg is a direct svg renderer not based on cairo)
	  -- -Txlib now available -- "dot -Tx11 foo.dot"  watches foo.dot with inotify and updates
	  -- -Tgtk now available -- eventually to provide a graph editing capability - not fully working
	  -- -Tswf "Flash" now available using the ming library. Currently has incomplete font support and not yet in Fedora rpms because ming not yet available as rpm.
	- remove hard gd dependencies from dot.  gd renderers now provided
	  as optional plugin.   Deprecated, but required for -Tjpg, -Tgif and -Tvrml.
	- gvpr - Add kindOf function, plus functions to set and get default values
	- dot - Implement esep attribute to allow graph to specify room
	around nodes for spline routing.
	- neato - add vpsc library and DIGCOLA
	- neato - add IPSEPCOLA additions from Tim Dwyer
	- move: -Tps, -Tfig, -Tsvg, -Timap/ismap/cmap/cmapx, -Tdot/xdot,
	from codegens to a "core" plugin.
	- dot - new usershape plugin mechanism potentially supporting
	  a wider range of input shape format -> output format combinations.
	display on changes
	- Fixes for builds on Mac OS/X
	- dot - new -O switch to automatically generate output file
	names based on the input filename and the -T value.
	 e.g.  "dot -Tpng -O *.dot"   
	Also works for case of multiple graphs in a single input file.
	- add support for "Brewer" color nameset
	- move reusable .so libraries to $PREFIX/lib per frequent request
	from Debian community.   Plugin .so's remain in $PREFIX/lib/graphviz.

February 3, 2006
	- release 2.8
	- (POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY) The default input scaling, in the
	absence of a "-s" switch, has been changed from inches to points.
	The new behavior of "neato" is equivalent to "neato -s72".
	The old behavior can be restored with "neato -s1".
	The purpose of this change is to avoid a Frequently-Made-Mistake
	when using "neato -n" to process a previously generated layout.
	Previously it was necessary to use "neato -n -s72", but with this
	change the default matches dot's output and the "-s72" is not required.
	- Added pseudo layout engines: "dot -Knop" and dot -Knop1" equivalent
	to "neato -n"
	- Added pseodo layout engine: "dot -Knop2" equivalent to "neato -n2"
	- Add support for color namespaces; add Brewer color data
	- Add support for simulated duplex edges using parallel edges:
	head arrow takes first color, tail arrow takes second color.
	- source code management moved back to CVS until GIT matures a bit more
	- distribute separe rpms for binares of language bindings : 
	- Add a small pad region around graph renderings to allow for finite
	penwidths at the drawing edges
	- Add protonode(g) and E=protoedge(g) functions to simplify
	language bindings.
	- Add special purpose code to deal with html labels from language
	bindings.
	- Various portability fixes for: HPUX, Mac OS/X, Cygwin, Windows.
	- Fix bugs 784, 786, 787, 788, 789, 790, 791, 793, 795, 796, 798, 799,
	    800, 801, 804, 806, 811, 812, 817, 820, 821, 823, 824, 825, 830,

April 27, 2001: graphviz-1.7.6

    NEW FEATURES

    Added a collection of graph processing tools:

    acyclic : a filter that takes a directed graph as input
    and outputs a copy of the graph with sufficient edges
    reversed to make the graph acyclic.

    ccomps : decomposes graphs into their connected components,
    printing the components to standard output.

    colorize : is a filter that sets node colors from initial
    seed values. Colors flow along edges from tail to head.

    gc : a graph analogue to wc in that it prints to standard
    output the number of nodes, edges, connected components or
    clusters contained in the input files.

    gpr : a graph stream editor inspired by awk. It copies
    input graphs to its output, possibly transforming their
    structure and attributes, creating new graphs, or
    printing arbitrary information.

    nop : reads a stream of graphs and prints each in
    pretty-printed (canonical) format on stdout.

    sccmap : decomposes digraphs into strongly connected components
    and an auxiliary map of the relationship between components.

    tred : computes the transitive reduction of directed graphs,
    and prints the resulting graphs to standard output. This
    removes edges implied by transitivity.

    unflatten : is a preprocessor to dot that is used to improve
    the aspect ratio of graphs having many leaves or disconnected
    nodes. The usual layout for such a graph is generally very
    wide or tall. unflatten inserts invisible edges or adjusts
    the minlen on edges to improve layout compaction.


    FIXES

    allocated by the layout engines.

    Some cluster layout fixes
